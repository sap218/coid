Following the MIRO guidelines for reporting on an ontology [1]

**A. The basics**
  * A.1 Unified Inflammatory Ontology (UFO) v1.0.0.
  * A.2 Ontology owner: [Samantha C Pendleton](mailto:samanfapc@gmail.com) MSc (Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK)
  * A.3 [License](https://github.com/sap218/ufo/blob/master/LICENSE), which governs the permissions surrounding the ontology, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
  * A.4 Located in `ontology` directory: https://github.com/sap218/ufo/blob/master/ontology/ufo.owl
  * A.5 GitHub repository: https://github.com/sap218/ufo.
  * A.6 Methodological framework: used [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) software for ontology building using ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, HPO, DOID, and other biomedical ontologies. Synonym expansion followed the works of Braithwaite et al. using the tf-idf statistical analysis to gain patient-preferred synonyms [2] from the [patient.info](https://patient.info/forums) forums. Additionally expanded with external domain-expert terms from [ClinicalBERT](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/clinicalBERT)
  
**B. Motivation**
  * B.1 Ontology is required as there currently lacks a system for inflammatory disorders, specifically the controlled vocabulary for these diseases & the need for understanding the “patient-voice” via symptoms and conditions.
  * B.2 UFO is derived from other biomedical ontologies, which are currently limited in the inflammatory domain in terms of synonyms, such as DOID and HPO.
  * B.3 Target audience are those in the research area looking at inflammatory conditions or the patient voice. In additional to those who wish to create an ontology in the method we have: the quick tf-idf method.

**C. Scope, requirements, development community**
  * C.1 The requirements of the ontology is to be an extensive vocabulary for inflammatory disorders, their associated diseases, medication, and symptoms. The ontology includes therapeutic interventions, investigations, symptoms, complications, and more.
  * C.2 Development community: [Samantha C Pendleton](mailto:samanfapc@gmail.com) MSc (Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK). In addition to Luke T Slater PhD, Andreas Karwath PhD, and Georgios V Gkoutos PhD.
  * C.3 Issue tracking system used for future developements/requests/bugs: https://github.com/sap218/ufo/issues 

**D. Knowledge acquisition**
  * D.1 Foundation built from ICD-10 codes: following the structure and then cross-reference to biomedical ontologies.
  * D.2 ICD-10 accessed via https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#/ - biomedical ontologies accessed via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index - patient forum access via https://patient.info/forums - and ClinicalBERT accessed via https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/clinicalBERT
  * D.3 Included inflammatory disorders were derived from: [ICD10Data](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Index/I/Inflammation%2C_inflamed%2C_inflammatory) & [ICD LIST](https://icdlist.com/?t=icd10&s=inflammation)
  
**E. Ontology content**
  * E.1 Ontology is `OWL/XML xmlns= "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#”` - ask creator if you wish for an alternative ontology format.
  * E.2 Specifically used [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to develop the ontology with Git version control.
  * E.3 Ontology metrics, as of 19-04-2021 version 1.0.0 (see [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/sap218/ufo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)) there are a total of 1116 classes, 7256 relationships and axioms, 4174 annotations, including 1755 database cross-references, and 603 patient-preferred synonyms.
  * E.4 Cross-references ontologies inclue: ICD-10, ICD-9, SNOMED-CT, READCODES, SYMP, DOID, BFO, HPO, ORDO, PATO, UBERON, and NCIT.
  * E.5 IRI for UFO is: https://github.com/sap218/UFO/blob/master/ontology/UFO.owl#UFO_00000.
  * E.6 Identifier generation policy: Protégé’s preferences schema is that ontology’s entities are to have the prefix “UFO” followed by an underscore then a five digit number. All classes have UFO prefix and own numeric identifier since UFO avoids importing axioms from other ontologies.
  * E.7 Entity metadata policy: currently `exact`, `broad`, `narrow`, and `related` synonyms in the ontology are additional clinical/medical terms derived from biomedical ontologies. However `layperson` are the patient-preferred terms, in addition to the ClinicalBERT terms.
  * E.8 ICD-10 was somewhat used as an upper ontology in the sense that the structure is followed when describing the inflammatory conditions.
  * E.9 Currently, relationship `occurs in` in UFO is cross-referenced to BFO. UFO defined it's own: `characterised by`, `patient reported symptom`, and `symptom of`.
  * E.10 Axiom patterns are inferred from the ontology structure itself (`subclass`) and by defined relationships.

**F. Managing change**
  * F.1 Sustainability plan: UFO is freely available on GitHub and the creator, Samantha C Pendleton, will constantly update/change based on expert opinion or via Issue notifications. Anyone from the community can suggest new terms, but with sufficient evidence/justification. Potentially users can `fork` the ontology and make their own changes, which then allows the creator to merge these changes. If often particular individuals are making positive/appropriate changes they can be given direct access to co-maintain the ontology with the creator.
  * F.2 There is the change log ([CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sap218/ufo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)) for entities to be removed/split/redefined, additionally we can annotate these entities as obsolete. 
  * F.3 Ontology will follow “semantic versioning” guidelines and that it will maintain as version 1 unless a major foundation change is made then it will become version 2. Otherwise additional terms/fixes will increment to version 1.1.0, and minor fixes will change to 1.0.1 over time.

**G. Quality Assurance**
  * G.1 Successful testing on the patient forum and ClinicalBERT embeddings. Also used Protégé’s HermiT (v1.4.3.456) reasoner to ensure a coherent and consistent ontology. 
  * G.2 Ontology is novel and first in basic inflammatory disorders. Additionally this method of building (tf-idf) was previous validated and our re-using proves a fast approach to synonym curation. UFO meets the stated requirements as an ontology suitable for the biomedical domain in additon to capturing the patient voice.
  * G.3 An example of application is using the ontology to perform ROC AUC analysis on ClinicalBERT to observe how clinicians and patients discuss conditions. Additionally layman terms can be used for sentiment analysis on patient forum text. Future applications include using ICD-10 codes for GWAS analysis on the UK Biobank cohort and other electronic health databases - UFO provides an implicit axiomatic structure for data annotated with SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, ICD-9, or READCODES as these are included as cross-references in the ontology, enhancing the potential value of UFO for searching and curating unstructured clinical data.
  * G.4 Ontology not yet available on on ontology repositories however freely available on GitHub - ask creator if you wish for an alternative ontology format.
  * G.5 Evidence of use: as soon as the manuscript is accepted the creator will include a reference/link here.
